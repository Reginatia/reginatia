## Hi, I'm Reginatia Adutwumwaa Amoah

üìßEmail: reginatiaamoah@gmail.com - Am happy to proceed everything with you so feel free o get in touch!

Sixth Former | Computer Science Enthusiast | I will like to Explore AI and Machine learning at university

The reason I am learning this is that, i love solving problems, and learning new technologies, i love coding, i love the fact that you need to apply what you have learn from knowledge. this makes me realise what i am capable of, the feeling after solving an error or figuring something up when coding, is something unexplanable to me. i feel so happy when am coding.
currently I'm focusing on HTML, CSS, GIT, JAVA SCRIPT, PYTHON, and JAVA. I'm in seciondary school right now so am learning the basics of this as a self study, i am planning on building a website with this programming after learning the in depth of it. 

## üöÄAbout Me
- üéìA year 13 Sixthform student, completinf on 2026. i started my self study in computer science by learning the basics, this was in late year12. i balance my school work with this. it sometimes feel hard, as it is a self study thing, if i dont get anything i need to through it well find websites, videos and AI chat box to help me understand some content or everything that i dont understand.
- üõ†Ô∏è Hands-on with tools: VS Code, Git, Github
- üìö Currently learning: An now on Javascript.
- üöÄLanguage: HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, Python, and Java Script
- üéØ Goal: I have a HTML project that i have created already, i created this along the video that i was watching, even tho i created the same thing, i always stop throughout the video code my own and then check if am correct as the video is playing. so i already have a html project. my goal is to finish the java script and then create a whole different project from the scratch, from html to javascript, i want to this on my own without any help, initializing my knowledge on what i learn.
- üå± Mindset: I learn 3-4 times a week, learning, growth-driven, and passionate about mastering my craft.
